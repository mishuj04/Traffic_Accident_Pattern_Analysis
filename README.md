# 🚦 Traffic Accident Hotspot & Safety Analytics  

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify **accident hotspots, temporal patterns, demographic factors, and road safety risks**.  
It leverages **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations**.  

---

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- Analyze accident data by **time (month, day, year, hour)**.  
- Study the impact of **driver demographics** (age, gender, alcohol influence).  
- Identify **high-risk accident hotspots** and patterns.  
- Evaluate **vehicle type & road infrastructure** contribution to fatalities.  
- Visualize insights using **bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps**.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes accident-level details such as:  
- `Accident_ID` → Unique identifier  
- `Date` → Date of accident  
- `Driver Age` → Age of driver  
- `Driver Gender` → Male/Female  
- `Number of Fatalities` → Fatalities per accident  
- `Vehicle Type` → Type of vehicle involved  
- `Road Type` → Highway, State Highway, Local Road, etc.  
- `Location` → Accident location details  
- `Alcohol Influence` → Yes/No
